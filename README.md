Create a Responsive Portfolio

For this activity you are going to use HTML, Bootstrap, and possibly some custom CSS to create a responsive portfolio. This should be built for both desktop and mobile screens.

Here is an example of my first portfolio

Requirements

Your portfolio should have 3 separate html files.

Example:
index.html could be your "About Me" page since that is a good home page.
contact.html could be used as a contact page.
portfolio.html could be used as the page where you display your projects.
You must have links to the other pages on EACH html page (think about using a navbar...)

Your "About Me" page must have a photo of yourself, and 2 separate paragraphs of content describing yourself.

Your "Contact" page must have a place where someone could input their name, email, and a message, and submit it. (it wont go anywhere...)

Your "Portfolio" page must contain at least 5+ images all evenly sized and spaced, each image should have a brief description.

Walk-through

Start by creating a NEW repo on github
Clone the repo to your computer using git clone <url> DO NOT USE THE (git init) COMMAND. DON'T DO IT!!!
Create your starter html code
Link bootstrap
Go to bootstraps webpage
Grab their CSS link, or copy it from here: <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3" crossorigin="anonymous">
Add the link to the <head> of your index.html, and all other html files you will use bootstrap in.
Make sure to set up your page using the proper grid of: container first, rows inside the container, cols inside the rows.
Here is an example
<!-- You only need 1 container for your page -->
<div class="container">
    <!-- You can have as many rows in a container that you would like -->
    <div class="row">
        <!-- You can have 12 cols in a row -->
        <div class="col">
            <!-- Content to be displayed to the page goes inside your 'col' divs -->
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
Your Goal!

You should have created 3 separate html files within this portfolio project.
Each file should represent a certain page of your portfolio.
You should show your knowledge of the various tools in bootstrap, you will find most of what you need in the categories highlighted in the image below.
